      <p><br></p>
      <p>Don't know where we disconnected each of our stories </p>
    <p>Now we go, once again, past where we have split off</p>
    <p>Even if, many times, we have been separated, you can see</p>
    <p>We're connected, still</p>
    <br><p>So, goodbye, farewell then </p>
    <p>We said the words, departed</p>
    <p>How many morning suns have we seen ever since that day</p>
    <p>In our respective new future destinations</p>
    <p>Extension of that day</p>
    <p>Today is when we meet</p>
    <br><p>With every moment that leads up to our meeting time </p>
    <p>I keep feeling my heart beating louder as the seconds pass</p>
    <p>As I look up at the sky that has cleared from the rain </p>
    <p>It was just like what we saw that day</p>
    <p>Upon us was a seven-colored bridge </p>
    <br><p>Here and now, we were able to meet once again</p>
    <p>We have kept our connection alive all along</p>
    <p>The things we talk about</p>
    <p>We wanna speak about</p>
    <p>Are never ending, overflowing out, and so</p>
    <p>Hold up, this won't be loosening, for we know</p>
    <p>We were rushed by the seasons, forever moving</p>
    <p>And beyond where the roads could be leading us to</p>
    <p>No matter where we stand</p>
    <p>As often as we want</p>
    <p>We gotta tie our strings together like before</p>
    <p>We'll meet again soon</p>
    <br><p>What was this?</p>
    <p>And now, we cannot end the reminiscence</p>
    <p>And those recollections, retentions</p>
    <p>We trace and we laugh </p>
    <p>Filling in sceneries we were living apart</p>
    <p>The conversation offer a shortcut </p>
    <p>And we don't even need to worry about tomorrow</p>
    <p>As if in a machine, and we're back to our past </p>
    <br><p>In any case </p>
    <p>Some changes that each of us have witnessed </p>
    <p>In total honesty, there's been too much of them</p>
    <p>But we know, till this day </p>
    <p>It's all of our surprise</p>
    <p>That everything is still the same</p>
    <br><p>When we look up at the sky, notice it's turning white </p>
    <p>We're exhausted and we see upon one side of our cheeks</p>
    <p>A gentle touch and a stroke from the warmth of the sun</p>
    <p>It was just like what we saw that day</p>
    <p>We return to our individual days</p>
    <br><p>Hey, every step that each of us have walked up to now  </p>
    <p>Has been on separate pathways, we know</p>
    <p>But the same morning sun is above and shining bright on us</p>
    <p>We've got to, once again, overlap now</p>
    <br><p>Don't know where we lost connection within our stories </p>
    <p>Once again, we return to what lies there beyond</p>
    <p>he things we talk about</p>
    <p>We wanna speak about</p>
    <p>The pages will soon be filling up, you'll see</p>
    <p>So, now, let's keep on adding to the story</p>
    <p>Even the setting red sun we looked up at once </p>
    <p>And the blue days of youth we have spent together</p>
    <p>Our memories won't forget</p>
    <p>Never to fade away</p>
    <p>And like the way the greens will always sprout </p>
    <p>We can meet again some time</p>
    <p>Our stories always start</p>
    <p>With a white morning sunshine every time, and so</p>
    <p>“See ya tomorrow”</p>
